The structure models are visualized by Jmol (https://jmol.sourceforge.net/),
version 16.3.5 by 2024-11-12.  The atom index is displayed by `label %i;` to
be issued on the program's own console.  For clarity of the presentation, the
stick scheme was used instead of the default ball-and-stick.  The dimension
of the .png exported was set to 500 by 400 pixels each.  To merge the relevant
.png about cysteine into the composite, Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/)
version 1.3.2 was used.
